# phone-directory
A phone directory project in C would involve designing a program that can store, manipulate and retrieve contact information for a list of individuals. The program should allow the user to add, delete, search and modify the contact details of each individual.

The phone directory should be implemented as a data structure, such as an array or linked list, to store the contact information for each person. The program should provide a user-friendly interface, with menus and options that allow the user to interact with the phone directory easily.

The program should prompt the user to enter the contact details, such as name, phone number, email address, and other relevant information for each individual. The user should be able to search for a particular person by name or phone number and view their contact details.

Additionally, the program should allow the user to modify the contact details of an existing person in the directory. The user should also be able to delete a person from the directory if required.

The phone directory project in C should be modular in design, with functions for each task that the program needs to perform. This would make it easier to maintain and update the program in the future.

Overall, the phone directory project in C should be an efficient and user-friendly program that can manage contact information for a list of individuals.
